              <li>Hiking the mountainous trails.</li>
              <li>The real outdoorsy type.</li>

          <p>
            After graduating from school, I went on to work customer-centric jobs. I worked with all types of people and eventually managed teams as well. While I enjoyed my job, it wasn't a career path that I was passionate about doing. Coding is something that I look forward to every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like gaming and mostly play on PC. I built my gaming computer a couple of years back and would recommend anyone to do so. When I'm not gaming, I often find myself streaming. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I've begun my journey to become a software engineer with <a class="b-links" href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, and it's the best decision I've taken.
